[Invoice King Pro](http://kingpro.me/plugins/invoice-king-pro/) makes creating and sending your invoices simple. The invoice creation interface gives you full control
over every word on your invoice. Choose a different theme to give your invoices the look, style and layout that you want. If there isn't a layout that
suits your needs, thats ok, it can be created! Themes are available on the [King Pro Plugins website](http://kingpro.me/plugins/invoice-king-pro/themes/).

The [Invoice King Pro](http://kingpro.me/plugins/invoice-king-pro/) settings area will allow you to set some data that will be consistent across all of your invoices, so that you don't need to enter them for every invoice
you create. Rest assured that if you need to change these details as a one-off, you can! Define your own columns for the invoice, no matter the theme/template/design.
Its your invoice, so you have control on what is on it. Once the columns have been defined, you set up the calculation for the invoice simply by assigning columns and 
operators. Finally assigning what column will calculate the subtotal column will find you on your way to creating and sending your invoices.

Client information is stored and editable in the system so next time you need to invoice them, it is even quicker to create your invoice. Just choose the existing client from
the dropdown and click the insert button which will populate all the client fields that the theme uses.

So you've created your invoice, "Now what?" you say. Watch your invoice transform into a PDF file that you can save and email manually or just check to make sure
the output meets your standards. Made a mistake in the details? No problem, the PDF is created on the fly so you can make a change and view your PDF again with the new
details.

Don't have the time to download your newly created PDF invoice and draft and email to your client with the invoice attached? [Invoice King Pro](http://kingpro.me/plugins/invoice-king-pro/) has you covered. Provided you
have entered and email address for the client you have attached to the invoice, you can email the invoice to your client straight from Wordpress! You can modify the details of
the email in the settings screen. Who it comes from and what email it comes from so that your client can simply reply to that email to contact you. Modify the subject
and body of the email to your liking. You can even insert invoice specific details into the subject and body of the email by using the variables listed! Suddenly you
have a dynamic invoicing email system at your finger tips!

Client requests a receipt? Guess what... [Invoice King Pro](http://kingpro.me/plugins/invoice-king-pro/) has your back! Simply change the invoice status to paid and email the client from the system again (you can download
the PDF again which will contain the paid status). [Invoice King Pro](http://kingpro.me/plugins/invoice-king-pro/) automatically adds a watermark on the document based on what you enter in the settings. Email the client
from the system with the invoice set to paid will send the paid message that you can also modify.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= After activating this plugin, my site has broken! Why? =

Nine times out of ten it will be due to your own scripts being added above the standard area where all the plugins are included. If you move your javascript files below the function, "wp_head()" in the "header.php" file of your theme, it should fix your problem.

= I change my columns in the settings yet my existing invoices don't show the change. Why? =

This is done to protect your existing invoices from future updates. You may run your invoices with a specific set of information for a year then update the set which wouldn't match your old invoices. If this wasn't in place your old invoice data would be lost.

= Some fields I see used around the plugin don't exist on my invoice. How do I set them? =

Not all themes will use every field available in the system. For example, the default theme that comes with the plugin does not use the clients contact details (address, phone, email) on the invoice, nor does the due date field get used. Some of the other themes available may use these.

= I made a change to my invoice and viewed the PDF to see the update, but it hasn't changed. Why? =

If your viewing this in the browser then its highly possible that your viewing a cached version. You should get your new version simply by refreshing the page. Depending on what browser you use will determine how it displays the PDF to you. You shouldn't have this problem if you download it.

= I get an error saying the PDF can't be saved due to write permissions on the server. What do I do? =

The plugin needs your permission to save the PDFs you generate to the output folder in the plugins folder. To do this, you are required to update the outputs permissions to be writable. Please see [the wordpress help page](http://codex.wordpress.org/Changing_File_Permissions) to carry this out
